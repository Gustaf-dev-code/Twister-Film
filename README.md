# Twister-Film

Hi, I am glad to share with you my new project that I have been working on to practice javascript and css3, along with API consumption with fetch.

Twister film, is a project that covers current information about movie releases, besides giving information about actors, directors, it also contains trailers and featured information. 

The project has a frontend part made with html5, css3 and vanilla javascript, all pages are responsive to different screen sizes. The frontend consumes TMDB API and shows featured movies, current movies and you can find different genres. It also has a dynamic search engine that allows you to find movies easily.
